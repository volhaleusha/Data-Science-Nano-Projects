This Tidy dataset is based on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0. The full describtion can be obtained here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

Dataset Explanation: 
===================
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. Each experiment is grouped by subject and activity.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. This features vectors were filtered later, and in final dataset only mean and std measurements provided.

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- Activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- A 86-feature vector with only mean and std measurements of time and frequency domain variables.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'readme.txt'

- 'codebook.txt': a detailed describtion of dataset and its variables

- 'tidydata.txt': Data set.


Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
