# Data-Science-Portfolio (under construction, please refer to other repositories)
My portfolio of data science projects for academic, certification and self-learning purposes 

## Content

### Machine learning

#### Python

+ [Deep Learning Specification on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning): (in Python, including Keras and Tensorflow). As part of specification completed following projects:
   - Cat classifier using logistic regression
   - 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer for Planar Dataset
   - Built Deep Neural Network step by step implementing layers in numpy and applied it on Cat vs non-cat Dataset
   - Improving Deep Neural Network: parameter tuning, optimization, batch normalization
   - Built Convolutional Neural Network step by step implementing layers in numpy 
   - Implemented a fully functioning ConvNet using TensorFlow on SIGNS dataset
   - Implemented Residual Network in Keras
   - Car Detection with YOLO model
   - Art Generation with Neural Style Transfer
   - Built Recurent Neural Network step by step implementing layers in numpy 
   - Implemented a model that uses an LSTM to generate music, etc.
