# Data-Science-Portfolio (under construction)
My portfolio of data science projects for academic, certification and self-learning purposes 

## Content

### Machine learning

#### Python

+ [Deep Learning Specification on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning): (in Python, including Keras and Tensorflow). [Certificate]. (https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/LDHQRBD65FV6)As part of specification completed following projects (my solutions for this specific specialization can not be publicaly posted in GitHub due to Coursera honor code):
   - Cat classifier using logistic regression
   - 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer for Planar Dataset
   - Built Deep Neural Network step by step implementing layers in numpy and applied it on Cat vs non-cat Dataset
   - Improving Deep Neural Network: parameter tuning, optimization, batch normalization
   - Built Convolutional Neural Network step by step implementing layers in numpy 
   - Implemented a fully functioning ConvNet using TensorFlow on SIGNS dataset
   - Implemented Residual Network in Keras
   - Car Detection with YOLO model
   - Art Generation with Neural Style Transfer
   - Built Recurent Neural Network step by step implementing layers in numpy 
   - Implemented a model that uses an LSTM to generate music, etc. 
   
   
#### Matlab   

+ [Machine Learning Course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome). [Certificate] (https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/CLFDDYW7B9DR). My solutions for this specific specialization can not be publicaly posted in GitHub due to Coursera honor code. Course includes projects on building linear regression, logistic regression, recommender system, neural network, support vector machine, dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection using MatLab.
