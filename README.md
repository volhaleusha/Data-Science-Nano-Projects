## Content

### Machine learning

#### Python

+ [Titanic: Detailed Feature Engineering, Encoding and Modeling](https://www.kaggle.com/volhaleusha/titanic-tutorial-encoding-feature-eng-81-8). In this project I am solving Titanic competition - dataset for beginners on Kaggle. The solution provided  achieved 81.8% on the public leaderboard. The main objective is not to simply solve the problem, but also to create tutorial on feature engineering, encoding, data cleaning stretegies and basic model tuning. 

+ [Prediction of Flavanoid content in wine](https://github.com/volhaleusha/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Machine%20Learning/Predict%20Alcohol%20Content). Built Linear Regression model to predict alcohol and flavanoid content in wine using pandas and numpy. Compared performance of this model to SkLearn model. 

+ [Deep Learning Specification on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning): (in Python, including Keras and Tensorflow). [Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/LDHQRBD65FV6). As part of specification completed following projects (my solutions for this specific specialization can not be publicaly posted in GitHub due to Coursera honor code):
   - Cat classifier using logistic regression
   - 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer for Planar Dataset
   - Built Deep Neural Network step by step implementing layers in numpy and applied it on Cat vs non-cat Dataset
   - Improving Deep Neural Network: parameter tuning, optimization, batch normalization
   - Built Convolutional Neural Network step by step implementing layers in numpy 
   - Implemented a fully functioning ConvNet using TensorFlow on SIGNS dataset
   - Implemented Residual Network in Keras
   - Car Detection with YOLO model
   - Art Generation with Neural Style Transfer
   - Built Recurrent Neural Network step by step implementing layers in numpy 
   - Implemented a model that uses an LSTM to generate music, etc. 
   
   
#### Matlab   

+ [Machine Learning Course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) (in MatLab). [Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/CLFDDYW7B9DR). My solutions for this specific specialization can not be publicaly posted in GitHub due to Coursera honor code. Course includes projects on building linear regression, logistic regression, recommender system, neural network, support vector machine, dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection.
   
   
### Statistics

#### R

+ [Basic Inferential Data Analysis](https://github.com/volhaleusha/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Statistics/Basic%20Inferential%20Data%20Analysis). Analysis of the ToothGrowth dataset including basic summary of dats and comparison of tooth growthby supp and dose using confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.

#### Python

+ [PCA and T-test](https://github.com/volhaleusha/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Statistics/PCA%20and%20T-test%20for%20Wine%20Dataset). Objective: understand how separable is wine dataset by classes and check which attributes are not separable using principle component analysis and t-test on wine dataset. 

### Exploration and Visualization

#### R

#### Python
+ [Hacker News Topics](https://github.com/volhaleusha/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Exploration%20and%20Visualization/Hacker%20News%20Topics). Objective of this projects is to look into Hacker News posts titles to identify the most common topics that users are posting, liking and talking about. Moreover, investigate and visualize most common posts' statistics by hours and weekdays.

### Data cleaning 
 
#### R 
  + [Creating a clean data set from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0](https://github.com/volhaleusha/Data-Science-Specialization-Projects/tree/master/Getting-and-Clearning-Data-Assignment)  (assignment solution for Data Science Certification)
