### Machine learning

#### Python

+ [Titanic: Detailed Feature Engineering, Encoding and Modeling](https://www.kaggle.com/volhaleusha/titanic-tutorial-encoding-feature-eng-81-8). In this project I am solving Titanic competition - dataset for beginners on Kaggle. The solution provided  achieved 81.8% on the public leaderboard. The main objective is not to simply solve the problem, but also to create tutorial on feature engineering, encoding, data cleaning stretegies and basic model tuning. 

+ [ML Charity: EDA, Model Tuning and Blend](https://github.com/volhaleusha/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Machine%20Learning/ML%20Charity). In this project, I apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML identify people most likely to donate to their cause. I will first explore and preprocess the data into a workable format. I will then evaluate several supervised learners and consider which are best suited for the solution. Afterwards, I will optimize the models selected and present it as a solution to CharityML. 

+ [Prediction of Flavanoid content in wine](https://github.com/volhaleusha/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Machine%20Learning/Predict%20Alcohol%20Content). Built Linear Regression model to predict alcohol and flavanoid content in wine using pandas and numpy. Compared performance of this model to SkLearn model. 
   
   
### Statistics

#### R

+ [Basic Inferential Data Analysis](https://github.com/volhaleusha/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Statistics/Basic%20Inferential%20Data%20Analysis). Analysis of the ToothGrowth dataset including basic summary of dats and comparison of tooth growthby supp and dose using confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.

#### Python

+ [PCA and T-test](https://github.com/volhaleusha/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Statistics/PCA%20and%20T-test%20for%20Wine%20Dataset). Objective: understand how separable is wine dataset by classes and check which attributes are not separable using principle component analysis and t-test on wine dataset. 

### Exploration and Visualization

#### R

#### Python
+ [Hacker News Topics](https://github.com/volhaleusha/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Exploration%20and%20Visualization/Hacker%20News%20Topics). Objective of this projects is to look into Hacker News posts titles to identify the most common topics that users are posting, liking and talking about. Moreover, investigate and visualize most common posts' statistics by hours and weekdays.

### Data cleaning 
 
#### R 
  + [Creating a clean data set from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0](https://github.com/volhaleusha/Data-Science-Specialization-Projects/tree/master/Getting-and-Clearning-Data-Assignment)  (assignment solution for Data Science Certification)
