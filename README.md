My portfolio of data science projects for academic, certification and self-learning purposes 

## Content

### Machine learning

#### Python

+ [Deep Learning Specification on Coursera](https://github.com/volhaleusha/Deep-Learning-Specification-Projects): (in Python, including Keras and Tensorflow). As part of specification completed following projects:
   - Cat classifier using logistic regression
   - 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer for Planar Dataset
   - Built Deep Neural Network step by step implementing layers in numpy and applied it on Cat vs non-cat Dataset
   - Improving Deep Neural Network: parameter tuning, optimization, batch normalization
   - Built Convolutional Neural Network step by step implementing layers in numpy 
   - Implemented a fully functioning ConvNet using TensorFlow on SIGNS dataset
   - Implemented Residual Network in Keras
   - Car Detection with YOLO model
   - Art Generation with Neural Style Transfer
   - Built Recurent Neural Network step by step implementing layers in numpy 
   - Implemented a model that uses an LSTM to generate music, etc. 
   
#### Matlab:
+ [Machine Learning Course Projects](https://github.com/volhaleusha/Machine-Learning-Course): (in Matlab). As part of this course completed exexrcises on topics: linear, logistic regression, neural networks, recommender systems, support vector machines, anomaly detection, dimensionality reduction.
