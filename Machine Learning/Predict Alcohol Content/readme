Objective of the project:
--------------------------

This folder contains project based on  Wine Dataset. This dataset is widely known for wine classification. 
However, this project is totally different. It targets to build regression model that can be successfully used on this 
dataset to predict flavanoids content in wine. Flavanoid was chosen as it is antioxidant and it helps to  prevent 
certain molecules, known as free radicals, from damaging cells. 

The project starts with exploration of dataset to inderstand if there is a possibility to predict predict flavanoid 
content at all. As the most impactfull features are chosen and preprocessed and hand made ste-py-step 
linear regression was built. 

Moreover, result were compared to SkLearn linear regression model to check performance of hand made model. 

Tools and models used:
-------------------------
Linear regression, t-test, numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, scipy, timeit

Results:
