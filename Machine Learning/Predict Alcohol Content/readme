This folder contains project based on  Wine Dataset. This dataset is widely known to be used for wine classification. 
However, this project is totally different. It targets to build regression model that can be successfully used on this 
dataset to predict other attributes that are not categorical.  
The project starts with exploration of dataset to inderstand if there is a possibility to predict any continuous 
variables at all. As the most interesting variable alcohol content was chosen and hand made simple linear regression was built.  
Moreover, result were compared to SkLearn linear regression model to check which one can achieve better result. And on top 
of this polynomial regression performance was checked.

It was discovered that models perform very similar to each other and give r^2 value of approximatelly 0.5. This means that 50%
of variation in alcohol content can be explained by linear regression model.
