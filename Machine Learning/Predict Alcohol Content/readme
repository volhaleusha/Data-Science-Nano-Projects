Objective of the project:
--------------------------

This folder contains project based on  Wine Dataset. This dataset is widely known for wine classification. 
However, this project is totally different. It targets to build regression model that can be successfully used on this 
dataset to predict other attributes that are not categorical.  

The project starts with exploration of dataset to inderstand if there is a possibility to predict any continuous 
variables at all. As the most interesting variables alcohol and flavanoids content were chosen and hand made ste-py-step 
simple linear regression was built. 

Moreover, result were compared to SkLearn linear regression model to check performance of hand made model. 

Tools and models used:
-------------------------
Linear regression, t-test, numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, scipy, timeit

Results:
------------------------
Achieved performance for alchol predictoin:
R^2 :50-60%

Achived performance for flavanoids prediction:
R^2: 80-90% 

Step-by-step model has proven to have similar results to SkLearn model with 95% confidence.
