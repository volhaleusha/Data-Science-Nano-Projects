Objective of the project:
--------------------------

In this project, I will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. 
census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. 
I will first explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, I will apply a series of transformations 
and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. I will then evaluate several supervised learners 
of your choice on the data, and consider which are best suited for the solution. Afterwards, I will optimize the models 
selected and present it as a solution to CharityML. Finally, you will explore the chosen model and its predictions under 
the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.
The success of your model will be determined based on models AUC or area under the curve associated with ROC curves. 

Tools and models used:
-------------------------
- RandomForestClassifier
- GaussianNB
- KNeighborsClassifier
- AdaBoostClassifier
- GradientBoostingClassifier
- LogisticRegression
- Seaborn, numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, scipy, timeit

Results:
------------------------
The best performance is achieved by blend of best two models models: Gradient Boosting and Adaboost
