Project Objective:
-----------------------------

This folder contains project based on  Wine Dataset. This dataset is widely known for wine classification. 
However, this project adds new analysis that is not presented in wine dataset tutorials. It targets to statistically check 
and proof that dataset is separable in terms of all attributes vs classes and also check which attributes are not separable.

Tools and models used: 
-----------------------------
During the project PCA and statistical t-tests are performed on dataset using scipy and Sklearn libraries
Also some visualization presented using such libraries as matplotlib and seaborn.


Projects results:
-----------------------------

It is shown that dataset can be succesfully used for wine classification.  
However, not all attributes are separable by classes. 
With 95% confidence it was discovered that out of 13 attributes 4 have the same mean for some classes.
