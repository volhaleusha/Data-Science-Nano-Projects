Project Objective: 
---------------------------

The objective of the project is to compare tooth growth by supp and dose for ToothGrowth dataset from Rdataset package.

Tools and models used:
---------------------------
Confidence interval, hypothesis testing, R markdown, ggplot2


Conclusions:
---------------------------
1. There is no enough evidence to say that supplement type effects tooth length  
2. Dosage increase results in tooth length increase
